After jumping to the 64 bit and jump to the C language kernel, I should prepare to jump to the 64 bit.

First of all, the output wasn't satisfying. So I've made a plan for that improvement.

After then,

![Now](/uploads/2017-06-29/OS/BatterOutput.png)

As you can see, that was changed.

And already fixed that miss typing SICCESS to SUCCESS on second.

But you know I'm so lazy for taking a new screenshot that was fixed.

So I'll use the unfixed image.

I've read a lot of code for this. 

First, I've fixed the 16bit bootloader assembly code for the 1~2 line output function.

Before the output function is:

```nasm

    push HELLO    
    push 0
    push 0
    call PRINT
    add sp, 6

```

You cannot display the color on the output.

So, I've fixed that. Now it requires four parameters for output. 

Currently, the output code is:

``` nasm

    push HELLO    
    push 0x0B
    push 30
    push 1
    call PRINT
    add sp, 8

```

Also, I've edited internal of a function. 

``` nasm

PRINT:
    push bp,
    mov bp, sp
    
    push es
    push si
    push di
    push ax
    push cx
    push dx    

    mov ax, 0xB800
    mov es, ax


    mov ax, word[bp + 4]
    mov si, 160
    mul si
    mov di, ax

    mov ax, word[bp + 6]
    
    mov si, 2
    mul si
    add di, ax

    mov si, word[bp+10]
    mov bl, byte[bp+8]
    
.PRINTLOOP
    mov cl, byte[si]
        
    cmp cl,0
    je .ENDPRINTLOOP

    mov byte[es:di], cl
    mov byte[es:di+1], bl
    add si, 1
    add di, 2
    jmp .PRINTLOOP

```

Uh, Pretty long line.

I've changed this code to use attribute code on bl register.

And then I've edited assembly code using 32bit code entry point for printing 32-bit mode change success message on 3 lines.


No big change.


```nasm
    push (SUCCESS - $$ + 0x10000)
    push 0x0A
    push 4
    push 60
    call PRINT
    add  esp, 16
```

Simply, It has been added attribute code.

Also, I've edited the function partly as well.


```nasm

PRINT:
    push ebp
    mov ebp, esp
    push esi
    push edi
    push eax
    push ecx
    push edx

    mov eax, dword [ebp + 12]
    mov esi, 160
    mul esi
    mov edi, eax
        
    mov eax, dword[ebp + 8]
    mov esi, 2
    mul esi
    add edi, eax
    mov bl, byte[ebp + 16]
    mov esi, dword[ebp + 20]    
.PRINTLOOP:
    mov cl, byte[esi]
    
    cmp cl,0
    je PRINTEND
    
    mov byte[edi + 0xB8000], cl
    mov byte[edi + 0xB8000+1], bl    
    add esi,1
    add edi,2    
    jmp .PRINTLOOP

```

It's same that inserting value by 'mov bl, byte[ebp+16]' and then using that on output code.

And then I added a parameter in function PrintVideoMemory for using C Language. 

The Implementation is:

```c

void PrintVideoMemory(int x, int y, BYTE Attribute ,const char* _str)
{
    CHARACTER_MEMORY* Address = ( CHARACTER_MEMORY* ) 0xB8000;
    
    int i = 0;
    
    Address+= ( y * 80 ) + x;

    for ( i = 0; _str[i] != 0; i++)
    {
        Address[i].bCharactor = _str[i];
        Address
        [i].bAttribute = Attribute;
    
    }
}

```

For my satisfaction, I've tried to change a few parts of codes even that hasn't existed on the book.

The pretty output makes me happy.

Also, I added the code for checking memory and set by 0 in the area for 64-bit kernel memory.

```c

BOOL Initalization64KernelMemoryArea()
{
    DWORD* Address
     = (DWORD*) 0x100000;
    
    while((DWORD) Address
     < 0x600000)
    {
        *Address
         = 0x00;

        if( *Address
         != 0 )
            return FALSE;
        Address
        ++;
    }
    
        
    return TRUE;
}


BOOL CheckMemorySize()
{
    DWORD* Address
     = (DWORD*) 0x100000;
    
    while( (DWORD) Address
    < 0x4000000 )
    {
        *Address
         = 0x12345678;

        if( *Address
         != 0x12345678)
            return FALSE;

        Address
         += (0x100000 / 4);
    }
    return TRUE;
    
}

```

These functions are used on the entry point for checking and printing messages.

I want to check this code working well. So I've changed command line in launch_qemu.sh.

Before change a commend is:


```
qemu-system-x86_64 -L . -m 64 -fda disk.img -localtime -M pc
```

If set up like that, Qemu allocates 64 MB memory by -m option.

![Again](/uploads/2017-06-29/OS/BatterOutput.png)

As you can see, It's working well.

So, Let me try to allow low memory to VM.

```
    qemu-system-x86_64 -L . -m 32 -fda disk.img -localtime -M pc
```
I give 32 MB memory to VM by -m 32 option.


![OutputError](/uploads/2017-06-29/OS/YesError.png)

Oh yeah!

That's what I wanna expect about it.

The left things used to turn on the paging, something ready for jumping to the 64 bit.

Also, I want to make the code much pretty. It looks like complex codes.
