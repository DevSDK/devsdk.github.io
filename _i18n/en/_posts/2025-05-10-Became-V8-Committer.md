I got v8 committer status in this morning.

Over the past two years, I’ve spent most of my spare time contributing to the V8 project

Here are some of the things I've worked on:
1.	Implemented Float16Array as a major new feature
  * [The first journey of implementing Float16Array into V8](https://blog.seokho.dev/development/2024/03/03/V8-Float16Array.html)
  * [Float16Array Turbofan Pipeline DevLog — Weekly Sync with V8 Leader](https://blog.seokho.dev/development/2025/02/21/V8-DevLogFloat16Array.html)
2.	Optimized several operations, including JIT compiler
  * [Optimize V8 Math.hypot - Hidden cost of the loop](https://blog.seokho.dev/development/2024/03/18/V8-optimize-MathHypot.html)
3.	Fixed long-standing bugs, including 7-year-old spec mismatches

I still remember when I said, "I'll become a V8 committer someday." And now, I am.

I'm surprised that there are only 75 committers worldwide, including me.

This project has taught me so much and introduced me to some amazing people.

I'm hopeful that my small contributions can help make the world a little better and safer and faster.

I'll keep putting in the effort, just like I always have.
