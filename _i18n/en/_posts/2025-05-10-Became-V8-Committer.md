I got v8 committer status in this morning.

Over the past two years, Iâ€™ve spent most of my spare time contributing to the V8 project

Here are some of the things I've worked on:
1.	Implemented Float16Array as a major new feature
2.	Optimized various operations in the JIT compiler
3.	Fixed long-standing bugs, including 7-year-old spec mismatches

I still remember when I said, "I'll become a V8 committer someday." And now, I am.

This project has taught me so much and introduced me to some amazing people.

I'll keep putting in the effort, just like I always have.
