This time, I will start my new Jekyll + GithubIO blog. 

This blog's goal is devlog, technical documents.

I felt quite annoyed when I build up this blog because I spent a lot of time choosing damm jkyll skin.

Chosen skin's colors weren't satisfied for me, so I modified CSS to change it. 

Also, I appended tag system.


I found some improvement points in this blog.


Well, Recently I develop:

Game Engine [GitHub](https://github.com/DevSDK/CometEngine)

And the Operating System for studying called 0SOS.

I will write posts when I develop that.
