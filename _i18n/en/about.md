Hi, I'm Seokho Song, the author of this blog.

I'm a person who loves to spend time productively like developing.

And I think the truth of  "I can change the world from my finger" always makes me exciting a lot.

That is why I'm trying to OpenSource.

I'm a university student in South Korea and major in Computer Science.

I love a challenge to handle something hard like 'kernel', 'game engine', 'algorithm', 'OS', and etc.  and I'm not afraid to do.

This blog is the story of how do I prepare to change the world.

Please read this blog in comfort and if you find something mistake, please comment below.
